An error number of 0 and message of the empty string mean \\u201cno error.\\u201d If the Last_Error value is not empty, it also appears as a message in the slave's error log. For example:\\n\\nLast_Errno: 1051\\nLast_Error: error 'Unknown table 'z'' on query 'drop table z'\\nThe message indicates that the table z existed on the master and was dropped there, but it did not exist on the slave, so DROP TABLE failed on the slave. (This might occur, for example, if you forget to copy the table to the slave when setting up replication.)\\n\\nNote\\nWhen the slave SQL thread receives an error, it reports the error first, then stops the SQL thread. This means that there is a small window of time during which SHOW SLAVE STATUS shows a nonzero value for Last_Errno even though Slave_SQL_Running still displays Yes.\\n\", \"Seconds_Behind_Master\": \"\\nThis field is an indication of how \\u201clate\\u201d the slave is:\\n\\nWhen the slave is actively processing updates, this field shows the difference between the current timestamp on the slave and the original timestamp logged on the master for the most event currently being processed on the slave.\\n\\nWhen no event is currently being processed on the slave, this value is 0.\\n\\nIn essence, this field measures the time difference in seconds between the slave SQL thread and the slave I/O thread. If the network connection between master and slave is fast, the slave I/O thread is very close to the master, so this field is a good approximation of how late the slave SQL thread is compared to the master. If the network is slow, this is not a good approximation; the slave SQL thread may quite often be caught up with the slow-reading slave I/O thread, so Seconds_Behind_Master often shows a value of 0, even if the I/O thread is late compared to the master. In other words, this column is useful only for fast networks.\\n\\nThis time difference computation works even if the master and slave do not have identical clock times, provided that the difference, computed when the slave I/O thread starts, remains constant from then on. Any changes\\u2014including NTP updates\\u2014can lead to clock skews that can make calculation of Seconds_Behind_Master less reliable.\\n\\nThis field is NULL (undefined or unknown) if the slave SQL thread is not running, or if the slave I/O thread is not running or is not connected to the master. For example, if the slave I/O thread is running but is not connected to the master and is sleeping for the number of seconds given by the CHANGE MASTER TO statement or --master-connect-retry option (default 60) before reconnecting, the value is NULL. This is because the slave cannot know what the master is doing, and so cannot say reliably how late it is.\\n\\nThe value of Seconds_Behind_Master is based on the timestamps stored in events, which are preserved through replication. This means that if a master M1 is itself a slave of M0, any event from M1's binary log that originates from M0's binary log has M0's timestamp for that event. This enables MySQL to replicate TIMESTAMP successfully. However, the problem for Seconds_Behind_Master is that if M1 also receives direct updates from clients, the Seconds_Behind_Master value randomly fluctuates because sometimes the last event from M1 originates from M0 and sometimes is the result of a direct update on M1.\", \"Master_User\": \"\\nThe user name of the account used to connect to the master.\\n\", \"Master_Port\": \"\\nThe port used to connect to the master.\\n\", \"Until_Log_Pos\": \"\\nThe values specified in the UNTIL clause of the START SLAVE statement.\\n\\nUntil_Condition has these values:\\n\\nNone if no UNTIL clause was specified\\n\\nMaster if the slave is reading until a given position in the master's binary log\\n\\nRelay if the slave is reading until a given position in its relay log\\n\\nUntil_Log_File and Until_Log_Pos indicate the log file name and position that define the coordinates at which the SQL thread stops executing.\\n\", \"Master_Log_File\": \"\\nThe name of the master binary log file from which the I/O thread is currently reading.\\n\", \"Read_Master_Log_Pos\": \"\\nThe position in the current master binary log file up to which the I/O thread has read.\\n\", \"Replicate_Do_DB\": \"\\nThe lists of databases that were specified with the --replicate-do-db and --replicate-ignore-db options, if any.\\n\", \"Exec_Master_Log_Pos\": \"\\nThe position in the current master binary log file to which the SQL thread has read and executed, marking the start of the next transaction or event to be processed. You can use this value with the CHANGE MASTER TO statement's MASTER_LOG_POS option when starting a new slave from an existing slave, so that the new slave reads from this point.

For a listing of possible states, see Section 8.10.6, \\u201cReplication Slave I/O Thread States\\u201d. For versions of MySQL prior to 5.0.12, it is necessary to check this field for connection problems. In those versions, the thread could be running while unsuccessfully trying to connect to the master; only this field makes you aware of the problem.
